# Reflection
The concept of this activity was not hard, but the hardhat version conflict (v2 vs v3) and other small formatting issue for the output made this activity take a lot longer than it was supposed to. Plus, the faucet being limited to once-per-day use was also difficult to work around. However, I am more confident in my deployment skills and able to navigate through a lot of errors (I've encountered many).
